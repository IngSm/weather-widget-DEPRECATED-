Hello, everybody!

This is a simple widget for usage on your website or on your desktop. 

I created this widget, because I failed to find some ready solutions for desktop widgets on windows machines.

At first it was a test task for a company:D

Please, buy me a coffee for this work, if it is useful for you:)

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and minifies for production as a web component
```
npm run wc-build
```
